aboutUs: <p>This symposium is hosted by the <a href="http://www.morgan.edu/research_and_economic_development.html">Division of Research and Economic Development (D-RED)</a>. It is made possible primarily by D-RED, the <a herf="http://www.morgan.edu/academic_affairs.html">Office of the Provost & Division of Academic Affairs</a> and the <a href="http://www.morgan.edu/sgjc">School of Global Journalism & Communication</a>. Our special thanks and appreciation are reserved for the <a href="http://www.morgan.edu/president">Office of the President</a> and several internal and external collaborators and sponsors. <br /><br /> The symposium is designed and organized by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/umarubah">Dr. Umaru Bah</a>, Associate Professor in the Department of Strategic Communication at School of Global Journalism & Communication.  It is part of a strategy geared toward the establishment of a Morgan Center for Open Data Education & Entrepreneurship (M-CODE2). <br /><br />In close collaboration with <a href="http://www.morgan.edu/research_and_economic_development/timothy_akers.html">Dr. Timothy Akers</a>, Assistant VP for Research Innovation & Advocacy, the symposium is structured to demonstrate the benefits and challenges of open data for civic engagement and sustainable development locally and globally. The symposium further serves as an opportunity to showcase Morgan State University as a well-positioned institutional partner for local and global data initiatives, academic enhancement, and research, with focus on minorities in the United States and abroad.<br /><br />It is also structured to demonstrate in content and practice the characteristics for optimal productivity in a global, open-sourced learning ecosystem. These include, across research, teaching and service activities, local and global interdisciplinary collaboration, public-private partnership, grantsmanship and entrepreneurship, user-centered designs and outcomes that privilege and facilitate community engagement and empowerment.<br /><br />This Morgan Open Data Working Symposium will scale up to a Morgan Open Data Working Conference in March 2017, with wider national and international participation and focus. We hope to leverage the networks, feedback and support therefrom to develop and submit the M-CODE2 Center grant proposal in June 2017. <br /><br />We welcome your participation and feedback. Feel free to <a href="mailto:info@morganopendate.net">contact us</a> with suggestions and inquiries.</p>

We realize that this is pretty short notice so we hope you can help us spread the word! There will be pizza, prizes and a great group of geeks to spend the evening coding with! Even if you don't have an app idea come on in and lend a hand to someone else or maybe find inspiration once you're here!"}
 - {title: "Google Glass", image: "hackathon-1.png", details: "We love wearable computing especially Google Glass for which we want to gather the break up community in order to boost innovation.<br><br>Coding an app on Google Glass needs its Rockstar Dev : the team needs a fast learner with solid skills on Android. He knows his way around Android SDK, already checked the Glass Developement Kit (GDK) quick start guide allowing him to jump start developing an app for Glass.The Designer has the hard task to build the visual identity from the ground up, he has strong UX knowledge and a deep understanding of the new rules set by the Glass. His design skills give him the credibility to decide the most effective UI and the most compelling Glass experience."}
 - {title: "Polymer", image: "hackathon-2.png", details: "Polymer is a library that introduces web components. Web components are small elements on a page that can be extended and incorporated in web applications. The result is an increase in productivity.<br><br>We used Polymer mainly to explore the concept of web components. The transition of Google to material design was also a factor.While the library was never touched by the team, it still was painless to wireframe the application. Later on we incorporated some Polymer components in the design. We didnât use the full potential of Polymer because of the limited time."}
