This one-day symposium brings together a diverse cross-section of scholars, practitioners, entrepreneurs, advocates and policymakers to demonstrate and critique some of the various tools, applications, benefits and pitfalls of open data, and to a lesser extent big data. Specific focus is on civic engagement and sustainable
development in Africa the African diaspora.



[Register now](https://goo.gl/forms/7LWZevQzkr9fS6Zj1) and come learn with us! As the [agenda](~/schedule) reflects, we plan to showcase the potential benefits and pitfalls of open data in a way that encourages and highlights the successes of:

- Local and global interdisciplinary collaboration.
- Public-private partnership
- User-centered designs and outcomes that privilege and facilitate community engagement and empowerment through innovation and social entrepreneurship

This symposium is hosted by the [Division of Research and Economic Development (D-RED)](www.morgan.edu/research_and_economic_development.html). It is made possible by D-RED, the [Office of the Provost & Division of Academic Affairs](www.morgan.edu/academic_affairs.html), the [School of Global Journalism & Communication](www.morgan.edu/sgjc), and several internal and external [collaborators and sponsors](/speakers).

#### The Challenge ###

Local and global initiatives involving open data—readily identifiable to some, with varying degrees of accuracy, as public records, public data or big data—continue to demonstrate the immeasurable wealth and potential that this resource holds for civic engagement, social entrepreneurship and sustainable development across all walks of life, locally and globally.

This treasure trove is expanding exponentially in developed countries, spurred to a large extent by information technology advancements that facilitate peer-to-peer data extraction, manipulation and sharing. A similar pattern is seen in developing countries as more and more laws relating to freedom-of-information access [(FOIA)](https://www.foia.gov/) are enacted, enabling more individual empowerment via greater civic engagement and individual political and economic empowerment.

Unfortunately, despite these promising developments and outlook, many minority communities (and the institutions and organizations that serve them) in the United States and internationally, remain unaware of the benefits of open data.

#### The Solution ####

This Morgan Open Data Working Symposium is one step toward addressing this critical shortcoming. As an HBCU (Historically Black College & University), we here at Morgan are passionate about our historical and contemporary obligations to promote and facilitate higher education access and benefits among minorities, as well as between minorities and more diverse communities nationwide and internationally.

#####  Specifically, we aim to achieve a four-fold goal:

- Demonstrate some of the various tools, applications benefits and potential pitfalls of open data.

- Showcase Morgan State University as a major local and global institutional host and partner of programs relating to data for civic engagement and sustainable development, particularly (but not exclusively) to Africa and the African diaspora.

- Kickstart build-up of required partnership and collaboration for the development and submission of a competitive million-dollar grant application for the Center in June 2017.

- Use this symposium as a pilot-run of the eventual Center’s programs and activities. Feedback and outcomes will be reflected in the scale-up event in March 2017 (i.e. Morgan Open Data Working Conference).



This Morgan Open Data Working Symposium will scale up to a Morgan Open Data Working Conference in March 2017, with wider national and international participation and focus. We hope to leverage the network, feedback and support therefrom to develop a successful proposal be early June 2017 for a Morgan Center for Open Data Education & Entrepreneurship (M-CODE2), with a twin-core focus on minority communities nationally and internationally, and on the African diaspora.
